## Aud-It

Converts image files (jpeg, png, etc.) as well as image captures into an audio source.

## Goals

I designed this project during my last module at Flatiron School as my Capstone Project. 
The objective of the application was to allow users to turn any documents with text into a listen-able source, much like an audiobook. 
The intended audience of this application would be for those who prefer to listen to materials rather than reading them on a book/screen.
